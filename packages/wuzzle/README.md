## Install

Install with npm:

```sh
npm install --save-dev wuzzle
```

Install with yarn:

```sh
yarn add --dev wuzzle
```

## Introduction

Wuzzle intends to provide a painless way to config all kinds of webpack compliations by:

- Hijacking and altering webpack configs inside webpack embedded bundlers.
- Transpiling files with webpack compilations.
- Registering webpack compilations on files requiring.

## Usage

### Hijacking and Altering

A bundler, as long as it has webpack embedded inside, is hijackable by wuzzle. Take [CRA](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for example:

```diff
  "scripts": {
-    "start": "react-scripts start",
+    "start": "wuzzle react-scripts start",
-    "build": "react-scripts build"
+    "build": "wuzzle react-scripts build"
  }
```

Prepend the `wuzzle` command. Then add a `wuzzle.config.js` file in app root to make alteration:

```js
module.exports = (webpackConfig, webpack) => {
  // ...
};
```

The `webpackConfig` is the final webpack config generated in target bundler to setup its webpack compilation. The `webpack` is the webpack object itself imported inside. Tweak the `webpackConfig` as needed to setup or teardown any parts of it. Also, an env variable `WUZZLE_COMMAND_ARGS` is available to help check currently executed sub commands or extra arguments in `wuzzle.config.js`. For now, this feature is guranteed to be working well against [CRA](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [Next](https://github.com/vercel/next.js), [Storybook](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/), [Razzle](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle), [Taro](https://github.com/nervjs/taro), [EW](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-webpack) and [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack). (But it's supposed to be good with other bundles as well.)
